3) Use flexbox to create a card style layout.

- Define a card to be 1/3 of the screen.
- Use the margin `calc` trick to get some nice spacing.
- Layout the cards using flexbox.
- Apply flexbox so that the Card items get flex layout.
- Ditch the `li`, and use span tags instead, so we can lay them out using flexbox.
